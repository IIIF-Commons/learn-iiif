title: What is IIIF?
---

We said earlier that IIIF is a series of APIs that allows you to access images on the Web. These APIs are community and use case driven and really were formed out of common needs from organizations delivering images on the Web.

This can be as simple as just putting an image tag in a webpage.

Or as advanced as reading a large book in its entirety.

Both of these use cases utilize IIIF. The API specifications enable all of this to be made possible in a standardized way. Simply put, IIIF enables organizations to solve common problems together.

IIIF not only refers to these APIs now, but now also to the community of content providers, software developers, and researchers who are using the technology.
