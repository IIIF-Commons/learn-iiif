The IIIF Presentation API gives us a specification for "presenting" images. A common example to think about this is a book.

If you want to display a group of images that represent pages in a book, you first need to know a few things about that book. You need to know what pages are in the book and the order of those pages. Perhaps you also want to show the book two pages at a time, with the pages facing the correct directions. This and much more can be accomplished using the IIIF Presentation API.
